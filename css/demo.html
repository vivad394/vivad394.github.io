    <div class="overflow"> First, we’re looking at the Django repository. This is the actual, real-life code that makes Django, the Web framework, run. It has 668 people keeping an eye on it, and 14,325 people have starred it as a favorite, and there are 5,692 forks—meaning that people have copied the code into their own repositories with some intention of manipulating and adding to or changing it. These numbers represent invested users. There are likely hundreds of thousands more who downloaded the code just to use it.

We see that a user, claudep, has checked in some code. He did this five hours ago, adding a “commit message” that reads “Fixed #24826—Accounted for filesystem-dependent filename max length.” He’s working in a file called tests.py, which means that this particular new code (marked in green and prefixed by “+” at the beginning of each line) is probably either test code or code to support tests. And thanks to user claudep, this code is now better than it was six hours ago.

This is the experience of using version control. It’s a combination news feed and backup system. GitHub didn’t invent version control. It took a program called git,38 which had been developed at first by Linus Torvalds, the chief architect of Linux, and started adding tools and services around it.

The way git works is that you can copy the code and all the changes ever made to the code with one command:</div>
